    <h2>About My Topic</h2>
    <p>It's no secret that the world can sometimes be a dangerous place to navigate, but such dangers will persist whether we like it or not and we must still live our lives. There's a saying that martial arts were invented to give the weak a chance to stand against the strong. After all, not everyone is gifted with immense strength and sometimes that are will abuse that power over others for nefarious purposes. Over time, self-defense has begun to include various tools and techniques such as weapons, kicks, punches, submissions, etc., but it can be difficult to navigate what the "best" advice for each individual would be when there's so much knowledge out there (often requiring monetary investment) and when some styles and rules of engagement seem to be more or less effective than others. I hope that this website can serve as a place where anyone with an internet connection is free to learn and discuss self-defense to receive an all-encompassing view of the best that the world of martial arts, safety training, and self-defense have to offer from multiple perspectives.

          <p>Martial arts and self defense training should be more accessible to those might deem it unaffordable. I believe that martial arts and gyms and schools that offer free classes at least once a week to the public are eligible to receive a tax cut for their charitable services to the community.</p>
